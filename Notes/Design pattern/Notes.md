DEPENDING ON SIZE OF THE USE ALL THE PATTENS AND DESIGIES


design patterns is written by 4 researcher call gang of four

solves many software problem. easy understandable, maintainable, testable and resueable.

SOLID
single responsibility:
A class should have only one reposibiltiy ex: sendEmail should only send emails should not validate the input
open/close principle:
a class should be close for modification and open for extension
Liskov
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program
ex: virtual and overridde example
Interface segregation
maintain good interfeaces
Dependency inversion principle[10]
One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretion


we have three categories in Design patterns
1)creational Patterns
    deals with the creation or construction of object. can be implicit(DI,reflection ex) or excplict. wholesa vs picewise
2)Structural Patterns
    concerned with the structure(exg class member), has wrapper classes the mimic the underline interface, good for API design
3)Behavioral Patterns
    They are all different, no central theme(they are diffrent)
